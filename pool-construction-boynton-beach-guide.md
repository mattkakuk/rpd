Beach County unique.

## Why Boynton Beach Is Perfect for Custom Pool Construction

### The Rising Demand for Luxury Pools in Boynton Beach

[Boynton Beach](https://www.boynton-beach.org/) has become one of South
Florida's most desirable communities, offering the perfect blend of coastal
living and suburban comfort. With year-round sunshine and an outdoor-centric
lifestyle, homeowners here are increasingly investing in custom pools that
transform their backyards into resort-style retreats. According to Palm Beach
County property records, pool additions consistently rank among the top home
improvements that boost property values in the area.

### Climate and Lifestyle Benefits

Picture this: It's a sunny Saturday afternoon, and instead of battling crowds
at the beach, you're floating in your crystal-clear pool, surrounded by
tropical landscaping and the comfort of your own backyard. That's the
lifestyle [Boynton
Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boynton_Beach,_Florida) residents enjoy
nearly every day of the year. With our subtropical climate averaging 230 sunny
days annually, a custom pool isn't just a luxury—it's a lifestyle investment
that you'll use constantly while significantly increasing your home's appeal
and value.

## Choosing the Right Pool Contractor in Boynton Beach

### What Separates Great Pool Builders from the Rest?

Not all pool companies are created equal, especially in South Florida where
unique soil conditions, water tables, and building codes require specialized
expertise. When searching for [pool builders in Boynton
Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3NwiV1XobWH6qEmX8), you need contractors who
understand local geology, have established relationships with Palm Beach
County permitting offices, and bring proven experience to every project.

The best pool contractors share several key characteristics: they maintain
proper licensing and insurance coverage, they have a portfolio of completed
projects you can view, they provide detailed written estimates with no hidden
fees, they communicate clearly throughout the construction process, and they
stand behind their work with solid warranties.

### Why RPD Custom Pools Stands Out

With decades of combined experience in pool construction throughout Palm Beach
County, our team at [RPD Custom
Pools](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3NwiV1XobWH6qEmX8) has earned our reputation as
one of the premier pool builders in the region. We don't just build pools—we
create custom aquatic environments tailored to your property, lifestyle, and
vision.

Our portfolio includes everything from elegant lap pools to expansive family
entertainment spaces with grottos, waterfalls, and integrated outdoor
kitchens. We've worked on historic properties near Ocean Avenue, modern
estates in Canyon Springs, and everything in between. But don't just take our
word for it; our [Google Business
Profile](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3NwiV1XobWH6qEmX8) showcases dozens of five-
star reviews from satisfied Boynton Beach homeowners.

## Understanding Pool Construction in Boynton Beach

### The Pool Building Process in South Florida

Building a pool in Boynton Beach involves several critical phases, each
requiring specialized knowledge and attention to detail. Understanding this
process helps you know what to expect and ensures you're working with a
contractor who follows industry best practices.

The journey begins with design consultation where we explore your vision,
assess your property, and discuss budget parameters. Next comes engineering
and permitting—crucial steps that ensure your pool meets all local codes and
will last for decades. The excavation phase requires careful attention to soil
conditions and water table levels that are unique to our coastal area.

Steel reinforcement installation creates the structural foundation, followed
by plumbing and electrical rough-ins that must meet strict Palm Beach County
codes. The shotcrete or gunite application forms your pool's shell, creating a
monolithic structure that's incredibly durable. After proper curing, we
install tile and coping, apply your chosen interior finish, construct decking,
and finally install equipment and bring your pool to life.

What makes Boynton Beach unique? The area's high water table, sandy soil
composition, and proximity to the Intracoastal Waterway mean that proper
engineering and drainage are absolutely essential. Our experienced team knows
exactly how to address these challenges, ensuring your pool remains
structurally sound for decades to come.

### Types of Pools We Build in Boynton Beach

 **Concrete/Gunite Pools:** The gold standard for customization and
durability, concrete pools allow for virtually any shape, size, or design
feature you can imagine. They 're perfect for Boynton Beach's climate and can
incorporate custom water features, beach entries, and integrated spas. If
you're looking for a truly unique design that reflects your personal style,
concrete is the way to go.

 **Fiberglass Pools:** These pre-manufactured shells offer faster installation
(typically 3-6 weeks versus 8-12 weeks for concrete) and lower long-term
maintenance. The smooth gelcoat surface resists algae growth and feels great
underfoot. They 're ideal for homeowners who want a beautiful pool on a
slightly tighter timeline and budget without sacrificing quality.

 **Vinyl Liner Pools:** While less common in South Florida due to sun exposure
concerns, vinyl pools can be a cost-effective option for certain applications
and are available with modern, attractive liner patterns. We typically
recommend these for budget-conscious projects where customization is less
critical.

### How Long Does Pool Construction Take in Boynton Beach?

This is one of the most common questions we receive at RPD Custom Pools, and
the answer depends on several factors. For a standard concrete pool with
typical features, you're looking at approximately 8-12 weeks from
groundbreaking to your first swim. This timeline breaks down roughly as
follows: permitting (2-3 weeks), excavation and steel (1 week), plumbing and
electrical rough-in (3-5 days), shotcrete application and curing (1-2 weeks),
tile and interior finish (1-2 weeks), decking construction (1-2 weeks), and
equipment installation and startup (3-5 days).

Fiberglass pools move faster—typically 3-6 weeks total—because the shell
arrives pre-manufactured and ready for installation. Custom features like
grottos, swim-up bars, or elaborate water features may extend the timeline,
but the stunning results are always worth the wait.

Weather plays a role too, especially during South Florida's rainy season from
June through September. We plan for contingencies and always keep you updated
on any timeline adjustments.

## Pool Construction Cost in Boynton Beach

### What Influences Your Investment?

Understanding pool construction costs helps you plan effectively and make
informed decisions. Several key factors affect your total investment in
Boynton Beach, and being aware of these helps you prioritize what matters most
to you.

 **Pool size and shape:** A simple rectangular pool costs less than an
elaborate freeform design with multiple levels and features. Generally, larger
pools cost more not just in materials but in excavation, finishing, and
ongoing maintenance.

 **Material selection:** Concrete, fiberglass, and vinyl have different price
points. Concrete offers maximum customization but higher initial costs.
Fiberglass falls in the middle range with lower maintenance costs. Vinyl
represents the budget-friendly option.

 **Custom features:** This is where your pool becomes uniquely yours.
Waterfalls, lighting systems, heating, automation, and spa integration all add
to the investment but dramatically enhance your enjoyment and property value.

 **Decking and hardscaping:** Your pool deck is almost as important as the
pool itself. Travertine, pavers, stamped concrete, or natural stone each have
different aesthetics and price points. The right choice depends on your style
preferences, budget, and how you plan to use the space.

 **Landscaping integration:** Tropical plants, privacy hedges, and outdoor
living spaces transform a pool from a simple water feature into a complete
backyard resort. Many of our clients invest in comprehensive outdoor
environments that include outdoor kitchens, fire pits, and covered living
areas.

 **Site conditions:** Challenging access, significant grading, or high water
tables can increase costs. Older neighborhoods sometimes have limited access
that requires smaller equipment or hand-digging in certain areas. We always
conduct a thorough site evaluation to identify potential challenges upfront.

### Average Pool Construction Costs in Boynton Beach

Let's talk numbers, because transparency is important when making a
significant investment. For a basic inground concrete pool (approximately
12×24 feet) with standard finishes, you're looking at an investment starting
around $50,000-$65,000. This gets you a quality pool with basic plaster
finish, standard tile and coping, basic equipment, and simple decking.

Mid-range projects with upgraded finishes, LED lighting, heating, and enhanced
decking typically range from $75,000-$95,000. At this level, you're adding
pebble or aggregate finishes, color-changing LED lighting, gas or heat pump
heating, saltwater chlorination, and premium decking materials like travertine
or high-end pavers.

Luxury custom pools with premium features, expansive decking, outdoor
kitchens, and sophisticated water features can range from $100,000-$200,000+.
These projects often include infinity edges, elaborate water features,
integrated spas with spillovers, fire features, extensive outdoor living
spaces, and top-tier automation systems.

These investments pay dividends. According to real estate professionals in
Palm Beach County, a well-designed pool can increase property values by 7-15%
and significantly reduce time on market when you eventually sell. But perhaps
more importantly, you get to enjoy your investment every single day you own
your home.

## Designing Your Dream Pool: Trends and Customization

### Popular Pool Features in Boynton Beach

What are Boynton Beach homeowners requesting? We see definite trends emerging
as pool technology advances and homeowners seek to maximize their outdoor
living experience. Here are the hottest trends we're seeing:

 **Beach entries and sun shelves:** Also called Baja shelves or tanning
ledges, these shallow areas (typically 6-12 inches deep) are perfect for
families with young children or anyone who loves lounging in shallow water
with a good book. They 're also ideal for placing lounge chairs right in the
water.

 **LED lighting systems:** Gone are the days of single white lights. Modern
LED systems offer color-changing capabilities, programmable light shows, and
energy efficiency that 's remarkable. Color-changing lights create stunning
nighttime ambiance and extend pool hours well into the evening for
entertaining.

 **Saltwater chlorination:** More homeowners are choosing saltwater systems
that generate chlorine automatically from salt. The water is gentler on skin
and eyes, there 's no chlorine smell, and maintenance is significantly easier.
You'll never haul chlorine buckets again.

 **Integrated spas:** Seamless spillover designs that blend hot tub luxury
with pool fun are incredibly popular. Imagine soaking in 102-degree water
while watching the kids play in the pool—that 's the beauty of an integrated
spa.

 **Fire and water features:** There 's something primal and mesmerizing about
fire and water together. Dramatic fire bowls, sheer descents, and natural rock
waterfalls create focal points that elevate your pool from ordinary to
extraordinary.

 **Smart pool automation:** Control temperature, lighting, cleaning cycles,
and even water features from your smartphone. Modern automation systems let
you heat your spa on the drive home from work or change your pool lighting for
a party—all from anywhere in the world.

### Incorporating Landscaping and Outdoor Living

A pool is just the beginning of creating your backyard paradise. The real
magic happens when we integrate your aquatic feature with comprehensive
landscaping and outdoor living spaces that make you never want to go inside.

Imagine palm trees swaying overhead, fragrant tropical flowers surrounding
your deck, and a covered patio with an outdoor kitchen where you can entertain
guests while keeping an eye on swimmers. Picture built-in barbecue islands
with granite countertops, refrigerators, and plenty of seating. Add a fire pit
area with comfortable outdoor furniture for cool winter evenings.

Our expertise in [water feature design](https://rpdfl.com/water-feature-
designer-south-florida/) means we can create naturalistic environments that
feel like private resorts. Whether you prefer a modern, geometric aesthetic or
a lush, tropical paradise, we'll bring your vision to life. We work with
experienced landscape architects who understand South Florida's climate and
can select plants that thrive with minimal maintenance while providing the
privacy and atmosphere you desire.

### Materials That Make a Difference

The finishing touches separate ordinary pools from extraordinary ones. We
specialize in premium materials that withstand South Florida's intense sun and
occasional salt air while maintaining their beauty for decades.

 **Pebble finishes:** These durable, textured surfaces come in various
colors—blues, grays, greens, and even black for a dramatic look. Pebble
finishes are more expensive than standard plaster but last significantly
longer and provide a luxurious feel.

 **Glass tile:** Stunning visual effects that shimmer underwater, glass tile
catches and reflects light in ways that transform your pool into a jewel.
Waterline glass tile adds sophistication and is available in countless colors
and patterns.

 **Natural stone coping:** Travertine, coral stone, or flagstone for timeless
elegance. The right coping material ties your pool to your home 's
architecture and provides a comfortable, cool surface around the pool
perimeter.

 **Custom stonework:** Our [stonework specialists](https://rpdfl.com/south-
florida-pool-custom-stonework/) create unique features that define your pool's
character—from natural boulder waterfalls to elegant stone veneer around spa
walls.

## Pool Remodeling: Refresh Your Existing Boynton Beach Pool

### Breathing New Life Into Older Pools

Already have a pool but it's looking dated? You're not alone. Many Boynton
Beach homes feature pools built in the 1980s and 1990s that function fine but
look tired. The good news is that [pool
remodeling](https://rpdflorida.com/pool-remodeling) can completely transform
your backyard without starting from scratch.

Our pool remodeling contractors specialize in updating older pools with modern
finishes, energy-efficient equipment, new tile and coping, LED lighting
upgrades, automation systems, and structural repairs. We've transformed
countless dated pools into contemporary showpieces that look like they were
built yesterday.

A typical remodel might include replacing worn plaster with a beautiful pebble
finish, updating white plastic light fixtures with colorful LED systems,
replacing outdated tile and coping with modern materials, upgrading to energy-
efficient pumps and heaters, adding a saltwater chlorination system, and
resurfacing or expanding your deck with travertine or pavers.

The investment for a comprehensive remodel typically ranges from
$20,000-$60,000 depending on the scope of work—a fraction of the cost of new
construction while delivering dramatic results. A remodel can give you that
resort-style appearance you've been dreaming of while increasing your property
value and enjoyment.

## The Permitting Process in Palm Beach County

### Navigating Local Regulations

Building a pool in Boynton Beach requires proper permits and adherence to Palm
Beach County building codes. While this might sound daunting, it's actually a
good thing—these regulations ensure your pool is built safely and will last
for decades.

Requirements include setback regulations from property lines and structures
(typically 10 feet from rear and side property lines), barrier regulations
including fencing and safety features (required by Florida law), electrical
code compliance specific to pool environments, and environmental
considerations for drainage and runoff.

The good news? We handle all of this for you. Our established relationships
with local building departments mean we know exactly what's required and how
to expedite the process. We submit all necessary documentation, schedule
inspections, and ensure every aspect of your pool meets or exceeds code
requirements.

Most clients never have to visit the permitting office or deal with
inspectors—we manage everything behind the scenes so you can focus on choosing
tile colors and planning your first pool party.

## Why Choose RPD Custom Pools for Your Boynton Beach Project?

### Deep Local Experience

We're not just pool builders—we're South Florida pool specialists with deep
roots in the community. Our team has completed hundreds of projects throughout
Boynton Beach, neighboring [Delray

Palm Beach County.

We understand the unique challenges and opportunities that come with building
in this area, from soil conditions to architectural styles that complement
local homes. We know which materials hold up best in our climate, which
equipment performs most reliably, and which designs work best for different
property types and lifestyles.

### Uncompromising Quality

From the initial consultation through final inspection, we maintain rigorous
quality standards at every phase. Our concrete pools feature properly
engineered steel reinforcement with rebar spacing that exceeds minimum code
requirements. We use premium shotcrete application with experienced nozzlemen
who've been doing this for decades.

We source materials from top-tier manufacturers like Pentair, Hayward, and
Jandy for equipment that lasts. Our tile and stone suppliers provide
commercial-grade materials designed for the harsh pool environment. Every
finish element receives meticulous attention because we know it's the details
that separate good pools from great pools.

We use only top-tier equipment from industry-leading manufacturers, backed by
comprehensive warranties. When you choose RPD Custom Pools, you're getting
quality that you can see, feel, and rely on for years to come.

### Customer-Focused Approach

Building a pool is a significant investment, and we treat it with the respect
it deserves. Our process emphasizes clear communication, transparent pricing,
and collaboration at every step. You'll never wonder what's happening with
your project or encounter surprise charges.

You'll have a dedicated project manager who keeps you informed throughout
construction and addresses any questions or concerns immediately. We return
calls and emails promptly, we show up when we say we will, and we treat your
property with the same care we'd want for our own homes.

We protect your existing landscaping during construction, we clean up
thoroughly at the end of each workday, and we don't consider the job complete
until you're thrilled with every detail. Our job isn't finished when the pool
is full—it's finished when you're completely satisfied.

## Our Proven Pool Construction Process

### Step 1: Design Consultation and Site Evaluation

Everything begins with understanding your vision, lifestyle needs, and
property characteristics. We'll visit your Boynton Beach home for a
complimentary consultation where we walk your property together, discuss how
you want to use your pool, explore design ideas and possibilities, review your
budget and timeline, and identify any potential site challenges.

This isn't a high-pressure sales call—it's a genuine conversation about your
goals and how we can help achieve them. We'll ask questions about who will use
the pool, what features matter most to you, how you entertain, and what your
long-term plans are for the property.

Then our designers create detailed renderings that show exactly what your
finished pool will look like. We use advanced 3D design software that lets you
virtually walk around your pool and see it from different angles. Want to see
what a different tile color looks like? We can show you instantly. Wondering
if a waterfall would look better on the left or right? We'll create both
options so you can compare.

### Step 2: Engineering and Permitting

Once you approve the design and we finalize every detail, our team handles all
engineering work and permit applications with Palm Beach County. We'll
coordinate with surveyors if property lines need verification, ensure all
setbacks and regulations are met, prepare detailed construction drawings and
specifications, and submit everything to the county for review.

We'll manage the entire approval process while keeping you updated on
progress. Most permitting takes 2-3 weeks, though complex projects or busy
times of year might extend this slightly. We build permitting time into our
overall timeline so you know exactly when construction will begin.

### Step 3: Excavation and Structural Work

Construction day is exciting! Before we bring equipment onto your property,
we'll mark all utility lines, establish access routes that protect your
landscaping, and set up erosion control measures if needed.

We'll carefully excavate your pool area using equipment sized appropriately
for your property access. We account for the high water table common in
Boynton Beach by dewatering if necessary and installing hydrostatic relief
valves that prevent your pool shell from "floating" if groundwater rises.

Next comes steel reinforcement installation—the skeleton of your pool. We
follow engineered specifications precisely, using the right rebar sizes and
spacing to create a structure that will last for generations. Then we rough in
all plumbing and electrical systems, positioning jets, drains, lights, and
equipment connections exactly where they need to be.

### Step 4: Shotcrete and Shell Completion

The shotcrete phase is when your pool really takes shape, transforming from a
hole in the ground to a recognizable pool. High-pressure application using
specialized equipment propels concrete through a hose and onto the steel
framework, creating an incredibly strong, waterproof shell.

Our experienced shotcrete crews have been doing this for decades. They know
how to achieve the right thickness (typically 8-10 inches for walls, 10-12
inches for floors), how to compact the concrete properly for maximum strength,
and how to create smooth transitions and contours that look beautiful and
function perfectly.

After application, the concrete needs to cure properly—usually 7-10 days
depending on weather conditions. During this time, we keep the shell moist and
protected, allowing it to achieve maximum strength before we proceed to
finishing work.

### Step 5: Finishing and Decking

Now comes the beautiful part—installing your chosen tile and coping that
creates the pool's visual identity. Tile installation is an art form,
especially with glass tile or intricate patterns. Our tile setters are
craftsmen who take pride in their work, creating crisp lines and perfectly
consistent grout joints.

We apply your selected interior finish, whether that's plaster, pebble, or
aggregate. This waterproof surface will feel smooth underfoot (or delightfully
textured with pebble) and provide the color and character you've chosen.
Application must happen in one continuous session to avoid visible seams or
color variations.

Decking construction comes next, transforming the area around your pool into
usable outdoor living space. Whether you've chosen travertine, pavers, stamped
concrete, or another material, we'll create a deck that's beautiful,
functional, and safe with proper drainage and non-slip surfaces.

Finally, we install equipment—pumps, filters, heaters, automation systems—and
lighting that brings your pool to life. Every piece is installed according to
manufacturer specifications and local codes, positioned for optimal
performance and easy future maintenance.

### Step 6: Final Details and Handover

We complete all landscaping elements that frame your pool and integrate it
into your yard. If you've included outdoor living features like kitchens or
fire pits, these receive final installation now.

Before we fill your pool, Palm Beach County conducts final inspections to
verify everything meets code. Once we have approval, we fill your pool and
begin startup procedures—balancing chemistry, checking all equipment
operation, and testing every feature to ensure everything works perfectly.

Then comes the best part: we train you on all aspects of pool operation and
maintenance. You'll learn how to use your automation system, understand basic
water chemistry, know when to call for service, and get tips for keeping your
pool looking its best with minimal effort.

You'll receive all warranty information for equipment and our workmanship
warranty. We provide our contact information for any future questions—and we
genuinely mean it. Many of our clients call with questions months or even
years later, and we're always happy to help.

## Frequently Asked Questions

 **1\. How much does pool construction cost in Boynton Beach?**

Pool construction costs in Boynton Beach typically range from $50,000 for a
basic inground pool to $200,000+ for luxury custom designs with premium
features. The exact cost depends on size, materials, features, and site
conditions. A standard 12×24 concrete pool with basic finishes starts around
$50,000-$65,000, while mid-range projects with upgraded finishes, LED
lighting, and heating run $75,000-$95,000. Luxury pools with extensive
features, elaborate water elements, and premium everything can exceed
$200,000. We provide detailed, transparent estimates during your consultation
that break down every cost so you know exactly where your investment goes.
Remember, a well-designed pool typically increases property values by 7-15% in
South Florida markets, making it an investment that pays returns both in
lifestyle enjoyment and financial value.

 **2\. What type of pool is best for Boynton Beach 's climate?**

Concrete/gunite pools are ideal for Boynton Beach because they're extremely
durable, highly customizable, and well-suited to South Florida's climate and
soil conditions. They can handle the high water table common in our area,
withstand intense sun exposure without fading, and can be engineered to last
50+ years with proper maintenance. The complete customization means you can
create any shape, size, or feature you can imagine—from beach entries to
infinity edges to elaborate water features. However, fiberglass pools are also
excellent choices for faster installation (3-6 weeks versus 8-12 weeks) and
lower maintenance requirements. Fiberglass shells resist algae growth and
require less chemical balancing. The best choice depends on your priorities:
choose concrete for maximum customization and long-term durability, or
fiberglass for faster installation and easier maintenance.

 **3\. How long does it take to build a pool in Boynton Beach?**

Most concrete pool projects take 8-12 weeks from start to finish, while
fiberglass installations typically complete in 3-6 weeks. The timeline breaks
down roughly as follows: permitting with Palm Beach County (2-3 weeks),
excavation and steel reinforcement (1 week), plumbing and electrical rough-in
(3-5 days), shotcrete application and curing (1-2 weeks), tile and interior
finish installation (1-2 weeks), decking construction (1-2 weeks), and
equipment installation and startup (3-5 days). Timeline factors include design
complexity (custom shapes and features take longer), permitting duration (can
vary based on county workload), weather conditions (rain can cause delays,
especially during summer months), and any custom features you choose like
grottos or elaborate water features. We build realistic timelines into every
project and keep you informed of progress throughout. The wait is worth
it—your pool will bring you joy for decades to come.

 **4\. Do I need a fence around my pool in Boynton Beach?**

Yes, Palm Beach County and Florida law require safety barriers around all
residential pools to prevent accidental drowning, particularly of young
children. We'll ensure your pool meets all local barrier requirements, which
typically include fencing at least 4 feet high with no gaps larger than 4
inches, self-closing, self-latching gates that open outward, latches
positioned at least 54 inches from the ground or with a childproof mechanism,
or approved door alarms and pool alarms if your home serves as part of the
barrier. Many homeowners choose attractive fencing options that enhance rather
than detract from their pool area—from glass panels that maintain views to
ornamental aluminum in styles that complement their home's architecture. We
can help you select barrier solutions that meet code while looking beautiful.
Safety requirements also include proper drain covers to prevent entrapment and
compliant electrical installations with GFCI protection.

 **5\. Will a pool increase my Boynton Beach home 's value?**

Absolutely! Well-designed pools typically increase property values by 7-15% in
South Florida markets like Boynton Beach, according to local real estate
professionals. They also make homes more attractive to buyers and can
significantly reduce time on market when you eventually sell. In our climate
where pools are usable year-round, they're not seen as luxury amenities but as
expected features in many neighborhoods and price ranges. The exact value
increase depends on factors like your neighborhood (pools add more value in
areas where they're common), the quality of your pool and surrounding
hardscape, how well your pool is maintained, and whether your pool fits
appropriately with your home's overall value. A $100,000 pool on a $300,000
home might not return its full cost, but a $100,000 pool on a $600,000 home
likely will. Beyond resale value, the lifestyle benefits and daily enjoyment
are invaluable—can you really put a price on the memories you'll create?
